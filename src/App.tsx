Here's the fixed version with the missing closing brackets and proper imports. The main issues were in the imports section at the top:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef } from 'react';
import { 
  Play, 
  Pause, 
  RotateCcw, 
  Settings, 
  ShoppingCart, 
  Trophy, 
  BarChart3, 
  Palette, 
  Coins, 
  Star, 
  Zap, 
  Shield, 
  TrendingUp, 
  Target,
  Gamepad2,
  Users,
  User,
  Gift
} from 'lucide-react';
```

The rest of the file was properly closed. I've removed the duplicate imports and consolidated them into a single import statement for the Lucide icons. The file now has proper closing brackets for all blocks and proper syntax throughout.
